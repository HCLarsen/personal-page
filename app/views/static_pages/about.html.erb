<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I currently live in Mississauga, Ontario, just outside of Toronto. In my younger years, I attended <a href="http://www.durhamcollege.ca/">Durham College</a>, where I earned a degree as an Electronics Engineering Technician. Since my graduation, I've worked as a salesperson for a number of companies in the electronics distribution and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>Aside from my day job, I still find time to tinker and play with electronics. Lately I've been working a lot with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html">Texas Instruments Launchpads</a>.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I've had an interest in software development that I've kept up in my free time. While I started with QBasic back in high school, I've since added far more languages to my repertoire. I'm familiar with C, C++, Objective-C, Labview, Java & Ruby.</p>
