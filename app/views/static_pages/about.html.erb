  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My interest in software development began in 1996, when I taught myself QBASIC by analyzing two example programs, and then writing my own. Learning the language without internet access or manuals was purely trial and error, and great fun. Next, I moved on to C, with a dictionary sized manual. In college, I learned Assembly Language, which I haven't used since, but has given me great insight into how software works at a really low level. Since then, I've taught myself Objective-C, LabVIEW, Java, Swift and Javascript. Currently, my main focus is on web technologies, with Ruby on Rails, and ReactJS.</p>
  <p>My interest in electronics started during childhood, when I would take apart (and sometimes fix) any device in the house that broke down. This interest is what led me to study electronics at <a href="http://www.durhamcollege.ca/">Durham College</a>. Recently, this interest has led me to work with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html">Texas Instruments Launchpad</a> platforms. I'm using these platforms to develop some personal IoT solutions.</p>
