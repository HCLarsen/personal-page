<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I currently live in Mississauga, Ontario, just outside of Toronto. Having grown up in Oshawa, on the other side of the Greater Toronto Area, I've lived in many parts of the area. I attended Durham College, now the Ontario Institute of Technology, where I earned a degree as an Electronics Engineering Technician. Since my graduation, I've worked as a salesperson for a number of companies in the electronics distribution and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>Aside from my job, I still find time to tinker and play with electronics. Lately I've been working a lot with the Raspberry Pi, and the Texas Instruments Launchpads.</p>
<p>For most of my life, I've had an interest in software development that I've kept up in my free time. While I started with QBasic back in high school, I've since added far more languages to my repertoire. I'm familiar with C, C++, Objective-C, Labview, Java & Ruby.</p>
