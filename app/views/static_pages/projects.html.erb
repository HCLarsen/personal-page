					<%= link_to "Spending Money", "https://spending-money.herokuapp.com", target:"_blank"%>
				</td>
				<td class="description">
					A simple money management app. You save your regular income and expenses. Then, you enter your current bank balance, and the app will calculate how much "spending money" you have available so that you don't fall behind your bills. I wrote this app in 8 hours.

				</td>
				<td class="description">
					My first real Swift project. This is my response to a friend's challenge to create an HTML parser without using any external libraries. As Swift doesn't have any native Regex functions, this was quite a challenge.
